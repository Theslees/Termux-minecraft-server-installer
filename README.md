# **!INSTALLATION GUIDE IS IN THE WIKI SECTION OF THIS GITHUB!**

## Current: v1.20.1

This is a simple script (originally designed for Termux) that will automatically install and configure a vanilla-optimized Quilt server for Minecraft Java (and in the future hopefully, Bedrock.)
You can add any Fabric or Quilt mod you want.


`I *had* an example of this running on my own android device; A Modded Survival experience, though It's no longer up. I instead host a MCPi server now. Please show love to a forgotten version of MC; github.com/MCPI-Revival` !!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Thanks to these things/people that made it possible !
> MC v1.19.2 - Synced server package manifest to client, updating the Netty framework to a version that makes this code work

> Quilt Mod Loader - Best solution for hosting MC servers imo (for personal use)

> Quilt Mod Loader Discord - Very cool people and devs helped me find compalibility issues

> The Mods - Lithium, FerriteCore, ViaFabric, ViaBackwards, Starlight, qfapi *(fabric library implementation + Quilt library from Quilt)*, Fabrictailor *(to change skins, do /skin)*, C2ME, VMP, alternate current.

> Sukiru - they're like a java dev or something, they were useful with answering my very urgent and serious questions. /s

### ⚠️ This guide assumes you are runnning a supported operating system.  ⚠️
The steps are in the Wiki section of this github repo inorder to reduce clutter here. Feedback is appriciated, my name and discord is Theslees#1162 if you need to reach out. (or any social really, I'm Theslees everywhere)


Please check if your system is compatible with this script before running it;

### ***Fedora-based, Debian-based, Arch Linux-based, Alpine-based, Termux.***


# To do

- Add Windows support in a different branch
- ~~Geyser support~~ removed geyser due to floodgate not working here, and to make this script minimal.
- ~~More Distros~~
- ~~Use functions to make it easier to read ig~~
- ~~Native Termux Support (remove the need for AnLinux.)~~
- In the wiki, make the linux section a single step using a universal command everyone can run to get the script up and going, or something. 
- Add options to install Bedrock or Java, though this is low priority. Bedrock deserves love too
