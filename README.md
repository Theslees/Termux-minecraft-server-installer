# **!INSTALLATION GUIDE IS IN THE WIKI SECTION OF THIS GITHUB!**

## Current: v1.20.1

This is a simple script (originally designed for Termux) that will automatically install and configure a vanilla-optimized Quilt server for Minecraft Java (and in the future hopefully, Bedrock.)
You can add any Fabric or Quilt mod you want.


`I *had* an example of this running on my own android device; A Modded Survival experience, though It's no longer up. I instead host a MCPi server now. Please show love to a forgotten version of MC; github.com/MCPI-Revival` !!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Thanks to these things/people that made it possible !
> MC v1.19.2 - Synced server package manifest to client, updating the Netty framework to a version that makes this code work

> Quilt Mod Loader - Best solution for hosting MC servers imo (for personal use)

> Quilt Mod Loader Discord - Very cool people and devs helped me find compalibility issues

> The Mods - Lithium, FerriteCore, ViaFabric, ViaBackwards, Starlight, qfapi *(fabric library implementation + Quilt library from Quilt)*, Fabrictailor *(to change skins, do /skin)*, C2ME, VMP, alternate current.

> Sukiru - they're like a java dev or something, they were useful with answering my very urgent and serious questions. /s
