# Termux-minecraft-server-installer
#### **!INSTALLATION GUIDE IS IN THE WIKI SECTION OF THIS GITHUB!**

## Current: v1.19.3

This is a simple script (originally designed for Termux) that will automatically install and configure a vanilla-optimized Quilt server for Minecraft Java (and in the future hopefully, Bedrock.)
You can add any Fabric or Quilt mod you want.

`I have an example of this running on my own android device; a Modded Survival experience. You can take a peak of its performance by joining; androidmc.hopto.org:25565` !!

## Thanks to these things/people that made it possible !
> MC v1.19.2 - Synced server package manifest to client, updating the Netty framework

> Quilt Mod Loader - Best solution for hosting MC servers imo (That isn't enterprise, proprietary, or designed for specific things.)

> Quilt Mod Loader Discord - Very cool people and devs helped me find compalibility issues, ty.

> The Mods - Lithium, VMP *(Very Many Players)*, FerriteCore, ViaFabric, ViaBackwards, ViaRewind, Starlight, qfapi *(fabric library implementation and Quilt library from Quilt)*, Fabrictailor *(to change skins, do /skin)*, Clumps, C2ME.

> Sukiru - they're like a java dev or something, they were useful with answering my very urgent and serious questions.
